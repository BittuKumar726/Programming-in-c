To sort a given array of strings into lexicographically increasing order or into
 an order in which the string with the lowest length appears first, a sorting 
function with a flag indicating the type of comparison strategy can be written.
 The disadvantage with doing so is having to rewrite the function for every new
 comparison strategy.

A better implementation would be to write a sorting function that accepts a 
pointer to the function that compares each pair of strings. Doing this will mean
 only passing a pointer to the sorting function with every new comparison 
strategy.


The arguments passed to this function are:

an array of strings : arr
length of string array: count
pointer to the string comparison function: cmp_func
You also need to implement the following four string comparison functions:

 1.int lexicographic_sort(char*,char*) to sort the strings in lexicographically non-decreasing order.

 2.int lexicographic_sort_reverse (char*, char*) to sort the strings in lexicographically non-increasing order.

 3.int sort_by_number_of_distinct_characters(char*, char*) to sort the strings in non-decreasing order of the number of distinct characters present in them. If two strings have the same number of distinct characters present in them, then the lexicographically smaller string should appear first.

4.int sort_by_length(char*, char*)  to sort the strings in non-decreasing order of their lengths. If two strings have the same length, then the lexicographically smaller string should appear first.
